# Indiebrew Landing Page

Hi üëãüèª,

In this project I've used the [Codewell](https://codewell.cc) platform to get access to free real-world design templates. This way I could practise my CSS & HTML skills by implementing life-like designs for free!!

## The Design
All of the assets (images & fonts), design template files and the [Codewell README](./indieBrew-starter-files/README.md) for this project were supplied with the downloadable starter-files folder on their website. I've included this in the root folder for comparison.

The tempalate files include landing page & sign-up page designs for mobile, tablet & desktop. I've implemented the mobile landing page and plan to implement all the others too. 

## My Real Web Version
All html and styling has been completed by myself. To check out my implementation of the designs go to my [GitHub Pages](https://bobbyiveson.github.io/indiebrew-landing-page/) site.
